# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- OpenCode 2 plugin API support (#102, PR #110)
  - The default export now exposes an `id` and `setup(ctx)` definition alongside the existing `server()` entrypoint.
  - Subscribes to the V2 event stream, maps V2 events (`session.execution.failed`, `session.execution.interrupted`, `session.inbox.enqueued`, ...) to the existing notification events, and registers the equivalent permission and tool hooks.
  - No configuration changes: the same package loads on OpenCode 1 and OpenCode 2.
  - The auto-approve permission check (wait + pending lookup, #98/#112) is preserved on both runtimes.

## [0.3.0-beta.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added
- Linux GNOME Wayland: `suppressWhenFocused` now works via AT-SPI focus detection (#105, follow-up #111; issues #83, #104)
  - GNOME exposes no compositor focus API and `xdotool` cannot see native Wayland windows, so the backend reads the AT-SPI `ACTIVE` state bit over `org.a11y.Bus` (requires `gdbus`)
  - Ghostty is matched by its `/com/mitchellh/ghostty` AT-SPI path, other terminals by app name (including the `gnome-terminal-server` AT-SPI alias)
  - Window identity is `bus@path` since AT-SPI object paths repeat across D-Bus bus names
  - Unknown window roles are excluded so a failed lookup fails open instead of suppressing a notification
  - Implemented and verified on Ubuntu 26.04.1 LTS + GNOME Shell 50.1 + Ghostty 1.3.0
  - Previously GNOME sessions always fell back to notifying (and with `notificationSystem: ghostty`, Ghostty hid its own banner while plugin sounds still played)
- Permission notifications are skipped when the request was auto-approved (#98, follow-up #112; issue #94)
  - On `permission.asked` the plugin waits 300ms and only notifies if the request is still pending; any lookup failure notifies (fail-open)
  - The shared dedupe window is claimed only when a notification actually fires, so a skipped auto-approved request no longer mutes a real one
- Added `OPENCODE_NOTIFIER_DEBUG=1` to log the focus backend decision (backend, `cached`/`current` window, session, result)
- README: install shortcut via `opencode plug -g @mohak34/opencode-notifier` (#99)

### Fixed
- Windows: PowerShell sound playback uses `-EncodedCommand` so args never contain spaces (#101)
- Security hardening: no child process is spawned through a shell anymore (#100)
  - All `execFileSync` calls use argv arrays with `shell: false`
  - Window IDs are validated before use; KWin socket uses `mkdtemp`; Ghostty fields are sanitized
- KDE: `qdbus` is resolved via `PATH` scan (including Fedora's versioned names) without invoking a shell (#103, #109)

## [0.2.8] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed
- Windows: PowerShell `-WindowStyle Hidden` no longer minimizes the parent terminal (#80)
  - Replaced `-WindowStyle Hidden` with Node.js `windowsHide: true` flag
  - Prevents both the console flash and terminal minimization

## [0.2.7] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- macOS: New `suppressGhosttySound` option to skip duplicate audio with Ghostty notifications (#78)
  - Set to `true` to prevent the plugin's sound from playing alongside macOS Notification Center's default sound
  - Only affects default (bundled) sounds — custom sounds still play
  - Disabled by default for backward compatibility

## [0.2.6] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- Windows: Hide PowerShell console window during focus checks (#77)
  - Added `-WindowStyle Hidden` to `powershell`/`pwsh` spawns in `getWindowsActiveWindowId()`
  - Prevents visible terminal flashes on every notification event
- SSH: Skip notification if D-Bus session bus is unavailable (#73)
  - Added `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` check before calling `notify-send`
  - Prevents 60-second hang when running over SSH without a desktop session

## [0.2.5] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- New `showFullPath` config option (#72)
  - Set to `true` to show the full absolute path in notification titles and the `{projectName}` token
  - Defaults to `false`, preserving the existing folder-name behavior
  - Useful when working across multiple projects with the same folder name

## [0.2.4] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Tmux Multi-client Focus:** Fixed an issue where `suppressWhenFocused` failed to suppress notifications in `tmux` if multiple clients were attached to the same session. (#71)
- **Minimum Duration Lookup:** Fixed a bug where top-level `minDuration` failed to suppress notifications because elapsed time was only calculated when custom command durations were set. (#68)

### Documentation
- Updated cache paths and troubleshooting steps in the README.
- Added missing configuration option docs and fixed broken markdown links.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- KDE Plasma notification jump-back action (#67)
  - Click "Jump to terminal" button on KDE notifications to focus the terminal
  - Uses kdotool or KWin scripts for focus routing
  - Captures startup window ID for deterministic jump-back
- WSL support (#65)
  - Detects WSL and routes notifications through Windows SnoreToast
  - Adds `customIconPath` config for Windows-native icon paths
- Minimum duration threshold for DONE notifications (#68)
  - New top-level `minDuration` config option (default: 0)
  - Suppresses `complete` and `subagent_complete` events when session finishes faster than threshold
  - Independent of `command.minDuration`

### Fixed
- tmux focus fallback when window detection fails (#69)
  - Uses tmux pane state as best-effort fallback on Linux setups where window focus is unavailable
  - Fixes `suppressWhenFocused` for GNOME Wayland + tmux users

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- New terminal bell channel (`bell`) with global and per-event controls (#56)
  - Global toggle: `bell`
  - Per-event toggle: `events.<event>.bell`
  - Emits terminal BEL (`\x07`) with TTY-safe behavior

### Fixed
- Added support for `plan_exit` notifications as a dedicated event (#59)
- macOS WezTerm focus detection now matches `wezterm-gui` frontmost app name reliably (#64)

### Changed
- README now documents bell behavior and quick validation command (`printf '\\a'`)
- Added regression tests for bell config/dispatch and WezTerm macOS focus mapping

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- Guard `{agentName}` extraction against non-string session titles (#57)
  - Prevents runtime `TypeError` when upstream session title data is not a string
  - Safely normalizes session title to `string | null` before placeholder extraction
  - Adds regression tests for non-string title inputs

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- WezTerm pane-aware focus suppression (#54)
  - Uses `WEZTERM_PANE` with `wezterm cli list-clients --format json`
  - Suppresses alerts only when your current WezTerm pane is focused
- New `{agentName}` placeholder for notifications and command args (#51)
  - Extracted from subagent session title suffix `(@name subagent)`
  - Resolves to empty string for non-subagent sessions
- Linux Niri focus detection support (#53)
  - Uses `niri msg --json focused-window` when `NIRI_SOCKET` is present

### Fixed
- tmux focus suppression hardening
  - Pane focus check now uses safer `tmux display-message` argument execution
  - Missing or failed tmux pane probe now fails open (notify instead of silent suppression)
- macOS focus suppression when running inside tmux (#50)
  - Handles `TERM_PROGRAM=tmux`/`screen` fallback correctly for terminal app matching
- Ghostty notifications inside tmux
  - Uses tmux passthrough wrapping for OSC 9 payloads so visual notifications render inside tmux
- Permission notification routing dedupe
  - Prevents duplicate permission alerts when both `permission.asked` event and `permission.ask` hook fire close together

### Changed
- Focus detection docs now match implementation details for tmux and WezTerm
- Added test coverage for WezTerm pane parsing and recently hardened focus paths

## [0.1.36] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- Remove legacy `permission.updated` handler to prevent duplicate sounds on Windows (#52)
  - The handler fired on every permission state change (asked + resolved), causing double sounds when the user took >1s to respond
  - `permission.asked` event and `permission.ask` hook already cover all modern OpenCode versions

## [0.1.35] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- macOS terminal focus detection now correctly identifies the frontmost app (#49)
  - Previously used window ID matching which failed when the terminal wasn't the active window
  - Now uses `osascript` to get the frontmost app name and checks against known terminal emulators
  - Supports Terminal, iTerm2, Ghostty, WezTerm, Alacritty, Kitty, Hyper, Warp, Tabby, Cursor, VS Code, Zed, Rio
  - Falls back to checking all known terminal names if `TERM_PROGRAM` is unset

## [0.1.34] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- New `enableOnDesktop` config option (#48)
  - Set to `true` to run the plugin on Desktop and Web clients (default: false)
  - By default, the plugin only runs on CLI to avoid duplicate notifications with Desktop's built-in notifications
  - When enabled, you get sounds, notifications, and custom commands on Desktop/Web
  - Useful if you want custom commands (Telegram, webhooks) but don't care about built-in notifications

### Fixed
- Windows active window detection now works correctly (#49) - @normanre
  - Previously the PowerShell here-string was incorrectly collapsed, causing detection to always fail
  - Now uses `-MemberDefinition` one-liner with proper `execFileSync` args array
  - Falls back to `pwsh` if `powershell` is not available

## [0.1.33] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Per-event `command` flag in events config to control whether the custom command runs for a specific event (#47) - @Odonno
  - Defaults to `true` for all events (backwards compatible)
  - Example: set `"command": false` on `subagent_complete` to suppress the command without affecting sound/notification

### Fixed
- Linux notifications now show `opencode` as the app name instead of the default `notify-send` label (#46) - @rhajizada
- mpv sound player no longer triggers the autoload script, preventing multiple sounds from playing at once (#42) - @ekisu

## [0.1.32] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- Plugin now correctly runs in CLI mode when `OPENCODE_CLIENT` is not set in the environment — previously `undefined !== "cli"` caused the plugin to silently return without firing any notifications

## [0.1.31] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- Ghostty notifications now use OSC 9 instead of OSC 777 — previously sent an unsupported sequence resulting in only a bell sound with no desktop notification banner (#38) - @raeperd
- Bundled `dist/index.js` no longer contains absolute source file paths from the build machine (#40) - @xxNull-lsk

### Changed
- Plugin no longer runs on Desktop and Web clients, which have built-in notification support (#39) - @ZTzTopia

## [0.1.30] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- New `suppressWhenFocused` config option to suppress notifications when the terminal running OpenCode is focused
- Works across all platforms: Hyprland, Sway, KDE Wayland, X11, macOS, Windows
- Full tmux support with session/window/pane awareness

### Fixed
- **Ghostty multi-window support:** Replaced PID-based detection with window ID comparison
  - Notifications now correctly trigger when switching between Ghostty windows
  - Ghostty uses a single process for all windows, so PID detection was matching any Ghostty window
- **tmux session awareness:** Fixed detection when switching between tmux sessions

### Known Limitations
- Ghostty native tabs (without tmux) cannot be distinguished — Ghostty does not yet expose a tab query IPC API ([ghostty-org/ghostty#2353](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/2353))

### Technical Changes
- New `src/focus.ts` module for cross-platform window focus detection
- Complete rewrite of focus detection logic (288 lines → 118 lines)
- No longer uses process ancestry walking

## [0.1.28] - 2026-02-23

## [0.1.27] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- Linux notification grouping support (#33)
- New `linux.grouping` config option to replace notifications in-place instead of stacking

- Added cleanup for session maps to avoid leaks

## [0.1.21] - 2026-02-18

### Added
